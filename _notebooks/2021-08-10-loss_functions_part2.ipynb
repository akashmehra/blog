    "## Mean Squared Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average of the squares of the errors for an estimator. The MSE of an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$​ wrt an unknown parameter $\\theta$​ is defined as $MSE(\\hat{\\theta})  =E[(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)^2]$​​​. It can also be written as the sum of  *Variance* and the squared *Bias* of the estimator. In case of an *unbiased* estimator the *MSE* and *variance* are equivalent. Below is a quick way to see how the MSE and the Variance and Bias are related to each other."
